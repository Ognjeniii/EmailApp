Email application

This is an application with which we can send emails with attechments.
The idea for application is to reduce time for sending many emails. This is for bigger companies that needs to 
send emails to their employees with their month salary.
You can also log in to the email from which you want to send messages. All of staff has the unique id in the database, and pdf file with id in the name of file.
The application goes through the pdf sheets and the database, and checks if the ids match. If ids matchs, pdf files become attechment which are 
going into the message. While the messages are being sent, clicking on the button, there is a possibility that the sending will be interrupted.
There are two databases, one to store email feedback, and another with employees. Employees can be added, deleted and their data changed.
